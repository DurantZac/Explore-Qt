# Explore-Qt
Messing around with Qt framework before possibly using it for the implementation of the Lorentz project
This repo is just for my own exploration of Qt - learning techniques I will need to complete the Lorentz project in C++/Qt
I decided to make a simple image viewer with the ability to draw on the images to get some practice using QPixmaps and signals/slots
for updating.
